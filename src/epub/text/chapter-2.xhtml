			<h2>PREPARER’S NOTE</h2>
			<p>The book this was typed from contains a complete Part I, and a partial Part II, as it seems only part of Part II survived the adventures described in the introduction. Where the text notes that pages are missing from the “original”, this refers to the Russian original, not the translation.</p>
			<p>All the foreign words were italicised in the original, a style not preserved here. Accents and diphthongs have also been left out.</p>
